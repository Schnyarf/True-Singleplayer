# True-Singleplayer
A mod for Minecraft 1.6.4 which removes the compulsory internal multiplayer server from Minecraft singleplayer. This greatly improves performance, fixes numerous bugs introduced by Minecraft 1.3, and restores UI elements from the pre-1.3 era.

This mod is the bedrock for the upcoming mods Project Golem and Better than Horses, and is provisionally based on Exalm's old SSP mod from the OldDays family of mods.

### Why 1.6.4?
This mod is part of a greater project of restoring the look, feel, and features of '[Golden Age](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoldenAgeMinecraft/)' versions of Minecraft to a modern version of the game. 1.6.4 is the final version of the game which can be repaired to such a state, as the release of Minecraft 1.7 fundamentally changed so many things that it would be a waste of time and energy to try and restore it.
