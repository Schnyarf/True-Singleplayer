# True Singleplayer
A mod for Minecraft 1.6.4 which removes the compulsory internal multiplayer server from Minecraft singleplayer. This greatly improves performance, fixes numerous bugs introduced by Minecraft 1.3, and restores UI elements from the pre-1.3 era.

This mod is the base for my upcoming mods Project Golem and Better than Horses, and is provisionally based on Exalm's old SSP mod from the [OldDays](https://github.com/Exalm/Minecraft-mods) family of mods.

### Why 1.6.4?
This mod is part of a greater project of restoring the look, feel, and features of '[Golden Age](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoldenAgeMinecraft/)' versions of Minecraft to a modern version of the game. 1.6.4 is the final version of the game which can be repaired to such a state, as the release of Minecraft 1.7 and subsequent versions changed so many things about the game to a point where it's fundamentally quite separate from what it was in the Beta 1.8–Release 1.5.2 era.

### What can I do with the contents of this repo?
I don't really know how to choose and enfore a legally-binding license at this time, particularly for a modification to existing software, but I ask that everybody, as a courtesy, adhere to the following terms.

#### You are free to use, modify, and share this code, please just:
- Give fair attribution to me, Schñarf.
- Don't make any commercial use of this mod without my permission.
- [Share-alike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share-alike).

In this spirit, I give special thanks to [Exalm](https://github.com/Exalm), who made the SSP mod many years ago which I am now using as a framework for this project. That project is now dormant, so please don't bother them about it.

And as a side note, you, yourself, are responsible for keeping sure that you do not get in trouble with the Microsoft-Mojang cops in any sort of distribution of this mod ;)—I'm probably gonna have to re-structure some things around here myself at some point.
