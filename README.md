# True Singleplayer
A mod for Minecraft 1.6.4 which removes the compulsory internal multiplayer server from Minecraft singleplayer. This greatly improves performance, fixes numerous bugs introduced by Minecraft 1.3, and restores UI elements from the pre-1.3 era.

This mod is the bedrock for my upcoming mods Project Golem and Better than Horses, and is provisionally based on Exalm's old SSP mod from the OldDays family of mods.

### Why 1.6.4?
This mod is part of a greater project of restoring the look, feel, and features of '[Golden Age](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoldenAgeMinecraft/)' versions of Minecraft to a modern version of the game. 1.6.4 is the final version of the game which can be repaired to such a state, as the release of Minecraft 1.7 and subsequent versions changed so many things about the game to a point where it's fundamentally quite separate from what it was in the Beta 1.8â€“Release 1.5.2 era.
